The maps in this directory are used to generate different types of locations.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a different location type.

Camp maps should adhere to these specifications:

-   82x82 pixels (camp is 80x80, 1 pixel buffer on each side)
-   Grass should be placed in 2x2 increments because the sprites don't look great when they're 1x1
