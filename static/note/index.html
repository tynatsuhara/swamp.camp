                    I started working on SWAMP CAMP at the beginning of COVID. I had tinkered with
                    writing a tiny HTML5 game engine the previous year, but hadn't gotten far with
                    it, and the pandemic was an opportunity to really invest my time in a project.
                    My only real goals starting out were to learn TypeScript and to have fun making
                    something.
                </div>
                <div>
                    I've slowly come to the realization that I will probably never finish this game.
                    That's a hard pill to swallow. I've considered myself a "game developer" for a
                    long time, despite the fact that I have not released much of anything. I have
                    felt (and continue to feel) like I don't have the legitimacy to call myself
                    that. For over a decade, I have loved building and tinkering with games, but I
                    have never been able to follow through with "finishing" something that was up to
                    my (admittedly far-too-high) standards. I know I am too self-critical, too much
                    of a perfectionist, but I also can't bring myself to compromise those standards.
                    Of course, this has become a double-edged sword, because I am now overwhelmed
                    with frustration at my lack of artistic output. After putting in so much time on
                    this project, I started to think it might be "the one" — the big project that I
                    would <i>actually</i> finish, after so many unfinished projects. And now that I
                    doubt my ability to ever do that, it's hard to not see it as a sunk cost, or to
                    feel that I will never be able to finish <i>any</i> game project. Realistically,
                    the scope that I envisioned for SWAMP CAMP is too big to ever really finish as a
                    part-time hobby project. I built the game for the least-ideal platform (the
                    web), using a custom engine, really making no attempts to make my life easier.
                    That was part of the fun, initially, and it has been a great learning
                    opportunity to do everything myself, but it's certainly not conducive to
                    actually finishing a project. Later on, I started to consider "releasing it" as
                    a goal, because I had put <i>so much</i> time into it, that it seemed absurd to
                    never let it see the light of day. Doing a "soft release" of the game online
                    felt good at the time, and I'm glad I have something to share with the world,
                    but long-term it has only added to the pressure I put on myself to "finish it"
                    (whatever that means).

                    Artistically, SWAMP CAMP has meant a great deal to me. It has given me countless
                    opportunities to learn, grow, and create over the course of the past few years.
                    I'm sure I have put in thousands of hours on this game, whether or not it shows.
                    My skills as an engineer, game designer, and artist have grown tremendously.
                    Most importantly, so has my self-awareness as a creative. Working on this game
                    has helped me learn a great deal about myself, the things that are important to
                    me, and how I want to focus my creative energy in the future. I've come to
                    recognize that I never built this game with the intention of having people play
                    it. I built it for me — following my creative whims and, for better or for
                    worse, paying no regard to scope or development timelines. It was a doodle in
                    the margins that grew to fill a whole notebook, and now I don't know what to do
                    with it. I worry that I might be limiting my growth by continuing to focus on
                    this game, rather than exploring other avenues of creativity. I don't want to
                    spend the rest of my life working on a single project just because I'm afraid of
                    abandoning it. This all feels a bit melodramatic, given no one will read this,
                    but this game has been a major focus of mine for years now. I feel I owe it to
                    myself, and the project, to reflect on that journey. I suppose, like the
                    development of the game, this note is really just for me.

                <div>
                    I don't know if I'm done with SWAMP CAMP. Part of me hopes I can move on, but
                    another part isn't sure if I can. Maybe, after some time apart, inspiration will
                    strike and I'll be consumed with passion for this project again. Maybe I'll
                    delete this note next week. Or, maybe I've gotten all I can from this project. I
                    hope, at the very least, that writing this will bring me a little bit of peace.
                    Regardless of the outcome, I am so grateful for this project, for everything I
                    have put into it and gotten out of it.
